# Managed Identity and Key Vault with ASP.NET Core

> Build an ASP.NET Core Web API using Managed Identity, Key Vault, and Cosmos DB that is designed to be deployed to Azure App Service or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as a Docker container

This is an ASP.NET Core Web API reference application designed to "fork and code" with the following features:

- Securely build, deploy and run an Azure App Service (Web App for Containers) application
- Securely build, deploy and run an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) application
- Use Managed Identity to securely access resources
- Securely store secrets in Key Vault
- Securely build and deploy the Docker container from Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Connect to and query Cosmos DB
- Automatically send telemetry and logs to Azure Monitor

> Instructions for setting up Key Vault, ACR, Azure Monitor and Cosmos DB are in the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)

## Prerequisites

- Bash shell (tested on Mac, Ubuntu, Windows with WSL2, CodeSpaces)
  - Will not work with WSL1 or Cloud Shell
- .NET Core SDK 3.1 ([download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))
- Docker CLI ([download](https://docs.docker.com/install/))
- Azure CLI ([download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest))
- Visual Studio Code (optional) ([download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

## Setup

### Code Spaces

- The easiest way to experiment with helium is using [CodeSpaces](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-codespaces/)
  - Fork this repo
  - Create a new CodeSpace pointing to the forked repo
  - Use the built-in bash shell

### Local Setup

- Fork this repo
- Clone the forked repo to your local machine
- All instructions assume starting from the root of the repo

## Run helium from bash

- The application requires Key Vault and Cosmos DB to be setup per the Helium setup [instructions](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)
- You can run the application locally by using Azure CLI cached credentials

### Validate az CLI works

```bash

# make sure you are logged into Azure
az account show

# if not, log in
az login

```

### Verify Key Vault Access

```bash

# verify you have access to Key Vault
az keyvault secret show --name CosmosDatabase --vault-name $He_Name

```

### Run the app

- If you are using CodeSpaces, you just need to set the --keyvault-name parameter and press F5
  - Open launch.json in the .vscode directory at the root of the repo
  - Replace `{your keyvault name}`

```bash

# make sure you are in the root of the repo
cd src/app
dotnet restore

# run in the background
# $He_Name is set to the name of your key vault during setup
# this will use Azure CLI cached credentials

dotnet run -- --keyvault-name $He_Name --auth-type CLI

# press ctl-c to stop the app

```

### In a separate terminal

```bash

# test the application
curl localhost:4120/version

```

### Deep Testing

We use [Web Validate](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/webvalidate) to run deep verification tests on the Web API

```bash

# install Web Validate as a dotnet global tool
# this is automatically installed in CodeSpaces
dotnet tool install -g webvalidate

# make sure you are in the root of the repository

# run the validation tests
# validation tests are located in the TestFiles directory
webv -s localhost:4120 -f baseline.json

# bad.json tests error conditions that return 4xx codes

# benchmark.json is a 300 request test that covers the entire API

```

## Build the release container using Docker

> For instructions on building the container with ACR, please see the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)

```bash

# make sure you are in the root of the repo
# build the image
docker build . -t helium-csharp

# run docker tag and docker push to push to your repo

```

## CI-CD

This repo uses [GitHub Actions](/.github/workflows/dockerCI.yml) for Continuous Integration. Detailed setup instructions are here: [ACR](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium/blob/master/docs/CI-CD/ACR.md) [DockerHub](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium/blob/master/docs/CI-CD/DockerHub.md)

- CI supports pushing to Azure Container Registry or DockerHub
- The action is setup to execute on a PR or commit to ```master```
  - The action does not run on commits to branches other than ```master```
- The action always publishes an image with the ```:beta``` tag
- If you tag the repo with a version i.e. ```v1.0.8``` the action will also
  - Tag the image with ```:1.0.8```
  - Tag the image with ```:stable```
  - Note that the ```v``` is case sensitive (lower case)

CD is supported via webhooks in Azure App Services connected to the ACR or DockerHub repository. See the Helium setup instructions for details.

### Testing

The end-to-end test is executed as part of the CI-CD pipeline and requires the Azure Service Principal be setup per the instructions above and the following `secrets` be set in your GitHub repo:

- Azure Login Information
  - TENANT
  - SERVICE_PRINCIPAL
  - SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_SECRET

### Pushing to Azure Container Registry

In order to push to ACR, you must create a Service Principal that has push permissions to the ACR and set the following `secrets` in your GitHub repo:

- ACR Information
  - ACR_REG
  - ACR_REPO
  - ACR_IMAGE

### Pushing to DockerHub

In order to push to DockerHub, you must set the following `secrets` in your GitHub repo:

- DOCKER_REPO
- DOCKER_USER
- DOCKER_PAT
  - Personal Access Token
