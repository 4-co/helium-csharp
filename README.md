# Build a Docker containerized ASP.NET Core web application using Managed Identity, Key Vault, and Cosmos DB that is designed to be deployed to Azure App Service or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

This is an ASP.NET Core Web API reference application designed to "fork and code" with the following features:

- Securely build, deploy and run an Azure App Service (Web App for Containers) application
- Securely build, deploy and run an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) application
- Use Managed Identity to securely access resources
- Securely store secrets in Key Vault
- Securely build and deploy the Docker container from Azure Container Registry (ACR) or Azure DevOps
- Connect to and query Cosmos DB
- Automatically send telemetry and logs to Azure Monitor
- Instructions for setting up Key Vault, ACR, Azure Monitor and Cosmos DB are in the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)

## Prerequisites

- Docker CLI ([download](https://docs.docker.com/install/))
- .NET Core SDK 3.0 ([download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))
- Azure CLI 2.0.72+ ([download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest))
- Visual Studio Code (optional) ([download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

## Setup

- Fork this repo and clone to your local machine
  - All instructions assume starting from the root of the repo

Build the container using Docker

- The unit tests run as part of the Docker build process. You can also run the unit tests manually.
- For instructions on building the container with ACR, please see the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)

```bash

# make sure you are in the root of the repo
# build the image
docker build -t helium-csharp -f Dockerfile .

# Tag and push the image to your Docker repo

```

Run the application locally

- The application requires Key Vault and Cosmos DB to be setup per the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)

```bash

# make sure you are in the root of the repo
cd src/app

# run in the background
dotnet run $He_Name &

# test the application
# the application takes about 10 seconds to start
curl http://localhost:4120/healthz

# Stop the app
fg

# press ctl-c

```

Run the application as a local container instead

```bash

# make sure you are in the root of the repo
cd ../..

# build the dev image
# docker-dev builds a full .NET Core SDK image with Azure CLI installed in the container
# you may see red warnings in the build output, they are safe to ignore
# examples: "debconf: ..." or "dpkg-preconfigure: ..."
docker build -t helium-dev -f Dockerfile-Dev .

# run the container
# mount your ~/.azure directory to container root/.azure directory
# you can also run the container and run az login from a bash shell
docker run -d -p 4120:4120 --name helium-dev -v ~/.azure:/root/.azure helium-dev "dotnet" "run" "${He_Name}"

# check the logs
# re-run until the application started message appears
docker logs helium-dev

# curl the health check endpoint
curl http://localhost:4120/healthz


# Stop and remove the container

docker stop helium-dev
docker rm helium-dev

```

Setup CI-CD with Azure DevOps

- The [pipeline file](azure-pipelines.yml) contains the build definition for this app
- You will need to setup a "Container Registry Service Connection" in Azure DevOps before importing the build pipeline
- The pipeline defines "helium" as the name of the service connection
- You can change this to an existing service connection or create a new service connection called helium
- If you use a different name, make sure to update the pipeline

Creating a new Azure DevOps project

- Open Azure DevOps
- Click on New Project
- Enter the project information
- Click on Create

Adding a Service Connection

- Click on the project created above
- Click on Project Settings
- Click on Service connections (under Pipelines heading)
- Click on New service connection
- Select Docker Registry
- Select Azure Container Registry
- Enter helium in the Connection name field
- Select your Azure Subscription
- Select your Container Registry
- Ensure Allow all pipelines to use this connection is checked
- Click OK

Adding a pipeline

- Click on Pipelines
- Click on Create your first Pipeline
- Select the repo that your code was forked to
- Click run
